# latent 

## Introduction
`latent`  is a framework for simulating impact of network conditions and Adaptive Bitrate Manifest engineering on Adpative streaming Quality of Experience. I got curious about how DASH/HLS/Smoothstreaming VOD manifest designs impact the load times and buffering times for streaming media playback and how the decisions made to construct such manifests and the corresponding heristics can affect media playback.
